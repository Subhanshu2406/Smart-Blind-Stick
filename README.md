# 🔷 BlindMate – A Smart Blind Stick

> Final project for *Engineering Design (2024–25)* at IIT Jodhpur

**BlindMate** is an assistive walking stick designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely using real-time obstacle detection. It uses ultrasonic sensors, a buzzer, and vibration motors to provide both audio and haptic feedback.

## 🛠️ Features

- **🧠 Obstacle Detection** using two ultrasonic sensors (left & right)
- **🔊 Buzzer Alerts** for immediate obstacle warnings
- **📳 Vibration Feedback** for silent/tactile alerts
- **🔋 Low-power & Lightweight** design
- **💸 Cost-effective** solution for wide accessibility

---

## 🚶‍♂️ Intended Users

- People with **partial or complete blindness**
- **Elderly individuals** with limited vision
- **Rehabilitation centers** serving the visually impaired

---

## 💡 How It Works

- If an object is detected within 20 cm on either side of the stick:
  - The **buzzer** turns on.
  - Both **vibration motors** activate.
- If there's no nearby obstacle:
  - The system remains silent and idle.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)**
- **Piezo Buzzer**
- **Vibration Motors**
- **Optional**: Accelerometer for fall detection *(in testing phase)*

---

## 🧩 Future Improvements

- Add **accelerometer-based fall detection**
- Integrate **GPS** for outdoor tracking and location sharing
- Add **voice feedback** via speaker for advanced audio guidance
